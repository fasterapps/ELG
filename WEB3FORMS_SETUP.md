# Web3Forms Setup Instructions

To enable the contact form, you just need to get an access key from Web3Forms.

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Get Your Access Key**
   - Go to [https://web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)
   - Enter your email address in the "Get Access Key" field
   - Click "Get Access Key"
   - Check your email for the access key

2. **Update Your Form**
   - Open `index.html` 
   - Find this line (around line 325):
     ```html
     <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual access key

3. **Optional: Custom Redirect**
   - To redirect to your own thank you page after submission, update line 328:
     ```html
     <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="https://earlylearningguide.com/thank-you">
     ```
